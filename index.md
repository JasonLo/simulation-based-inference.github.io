# Introduction

Simulators are the modern manifestation of scientific theories. They implement mechanistic models of the underlying natural phenomena of interest as well as models for the instruments used to observe those phenomena. The expressiveness of programming languages facilitates the development of complex, high-fidelity simulations and the power of modern computing provides the ability to generate synthetic data from them. The flexibility of simulators has made them critical research tools (and major cyberinfrastructure investments) for predicting how systems will behave across many areas of science and engineering. Unfortunately, despite their predictive power, these *simulators are poorly suited for statistical inference*, which is a core aspect of data-intensive science. To meet this challenge, there are an emerging set of techniques for simulation-based inference (SBI).

Simulation-based inference is the next step in the methodological evolution of statistical practice in the sciences. SBI provides qualitatively new capabilities that can transform scientific practice for our core science drivers of evolutionary biology, systems biology, and particle physics. Inference problems in these areas are challenging because they involve high-dimensional, richly-structured spaces. Similar challenges are encountered in fields beyond our targeted areas including neuro- science, gravitational wave astronomy, dark matter astrophysics, and cosmology. Empowering domain scientists with the ability to directly infer from data the properties of the underlying mech- anistic models that they are developing would be transformative.

SBI has also proven to be an effective lingua franca that facilitates communication between domain scientists and methodological experts, supports convergence research, and accelerates cross- pollination of ideas between fields. 

# Selected Papers

The plan is to turn this page into a crowd-sourced community resource that can collect recent papers including methodological developments and applications. We are working on the underlying infrastructure, but it will probably be similar to what drives the [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org) webpages( [source](http://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io-source) ) and/or something like this [living review](https://github.com/iml-wg/HEPML-LivingReview).

Here are some links to get started:

 * [The frontier of simulation-based inference](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1912789117) review by Kyle Cranmer, Johann Brehmer, and Gilles Louppe

 * Google Scholar searches for ["Simulation-based inference"](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&q=%22simulation-based+inference%22+&btnG=) and ["likelihood-free"](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&q=%22likelihood-free%22+&btnG=) 

# Selected Software

An initial list of SBI-related software packages
